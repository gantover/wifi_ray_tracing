# Wifi Ray Tracing
Ray Tracer to approximate wifi propagation/availability in a given 2d space

### School project (fake) context
The company OPERA-WCG is about to open new offices. Since the wifi has not been installed yet, this project
aims to provide optimial solutions to place emitters depending on the available budget.

### Particularities
- Uses gpu to make the calculation in parallel allowing a significant time improvement. It does it via the *taichi* python library
- All hypothesis can be found inside the [report](/report/Rapport%20RT%20Sess1%20-%20%5BHubert%20Damian%5D.pdf)
